# BayesianPOSTagger
A Bayesian POS Tagger in Perl 5.
Algorithms implemented:

1) Naive Bayes
2) Complete Naive Bayes (CNB)
3) Gibbs Sampling: random extraction, max frequent on to_sample samples and max on position

Idea and algorithm described in the following papers:
1) For CNB: [Part of Speech Tagging with Na√Øve Bayes Methods](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264743842_Part_of_Speech_Tagging_with_Naive_Bayes_Methods)
2) For Gibbs Sampling(Idea for the approach): [Bayesian Analysis for Natural Language Processing](https://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00905ED2V01Y201903HLT041)
